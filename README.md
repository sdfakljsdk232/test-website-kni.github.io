# Welcome to my website!

## What I will present here
My focus will be on:
- seeing how a website works
- understanding the basics of git
- finding ways to progress

## What you can expect
Honestly, **not much**... This is only a test page.

### Wups, sorry!
Well that's ok

### But I really meant it.
I know.

# What else will be displayed?
**That's it** my man... Ah nah, maybe
- a selection of my repos / projects
- potentially a visualization of some interesting data projects
- an about section at some point?
